        <li>Take a blender and add plum tomatoes,
             roasted red bell
              peppers, onion, and a scotch bonnet pepper.
               Blend until you have a smooth, spicy paste.
        </li>
        <li>In a large saucepan,
             add sunflower oil and heat over high heat.
              Once the oil is hot, pour in the blended sauce
               and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes,
                stirring.</li>
        <li>To the cooked sauce,

        <li>To the saucepan,

              rice to the saucepan and stir.
               Add water to cover the rice and
                cook over medium-low heat for 10
                 to 15 minutes.</li>

             rice, add an

               of water, and stir every
                few minutes to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Flavor the rice
             with bay leaves and half of a
              thinly sliced onion (optional),
               stir and cook over low heat until the rice is tender and flavor-packed.</li>
